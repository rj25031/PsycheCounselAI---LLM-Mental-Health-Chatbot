    content:
      "This is one of those rare therapies that actually puts your privacy first. I did not have to create a login or account of any kind. Stress and anxiety are such personal and private conditions that have historically prevented me from using other apps. Earkick has handled it really well. Overall I am impressed with the app so far. It reminds me to log things without being too intrusive and the exercises are quick enough to feel just right to calm me down. It has got me doing things in a regular basis which is the key to managing stress.",
